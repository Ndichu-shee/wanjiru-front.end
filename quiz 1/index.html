    <h1><b>my name is Wanjiru Ndichu</b></h1>

     <p>The days passed and the young boy was finally able to tell his father that all the nails were gone. The father took his son by the hand and led him to the fence.</p>

    <h2><b>This is my Second Heading</b></h2>

     <p>You have done well, my son, but look at the holes in the fence. <br>The fence will never be the same. When you say things in anger, they leave a scar just like this one. You can put a knife in a man and draw it out. It won’t matter how many times you say I’m sorry, the wound is still there.</p>
    
    <h3>Happy life</h3>

    <p>Sometimes we make the process more complicated than we need to. We will never make a journey of a thousand miles by fretting about how long.<br> it will take or how hard it will be. We make the journey by taking each day step by step and then repeating it again and again until we reach our destination.</p>

    <h4>process</h4>

    <p>Life is an ever-flowing process and somewhere on the path some unpleasant things will pop up – it might leave a scar, but then life is flowing, and like running water.<b>when it stops it grows stale. Go bravely on, my friend, because each experience teaches us a lesson. Keep blasting because life is such that sometimes it is nice and sometimes it is not</p>
